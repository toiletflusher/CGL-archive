This is an archive of the CGL repo before ohno9119 decided to delete it.

All credits go to eyes, ohno9119, jwilins (and the GTK devs, of course) for their contributions.

CGL is a library for creating graphical user interfaces. 
Offering a complete set of widgets, CGL is suitable for projects ranging from small one-off projects to complete application suites.

May CGL rest in peace.
